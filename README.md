Pulling from San Francisco open data, you'll get a map showing you spots for metered and unmetered spots in the city! Metered parking will show you the rate too. Quick tap will get you directions (with the native maps app). You can search for locations and landmarks too, and then see what's nearby.  Use the hybrid map to see the parking spaces for a better idea of where it is and what the parking situation looks like.  

This app is totally private with no data collection and totally free and open source.

Data is pulled from [DataSF | Open Data Portal](https://data.sfgov.org):
